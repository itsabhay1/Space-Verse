# 🚀 Spaceverse - Space Cargo Management System

**Spaceverse** is a backend system designed to manage cargo placement, movement, and retrieval inside storage containers at a space station. The system ensures items are stored efficiently based on spatial constraints, priority, and other critical metadata.

## 🌌 Problem Overview

Managing cargo in space is highly constrained due to:
- Limited storage volume
- Weight balance and dimensions
- Safety and accessibility of critical items (oxygen, food, tools)
- Prioritization of usage (expiry date, usage limit)

**Spaceverse** solves this by:
- Storing 3D space dimensions of each container
- Using placement algorithms to prevent overlap
- Supporting movement and removal of items
- Tracking preferred zones and item usage
